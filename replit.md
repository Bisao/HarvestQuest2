- **class-variance-authority**: Component variant management
- **lucide-react**: Icon library

### Development Tools
- **typescript**: Type safety across the stack
- **@replit/vite-plugin-***: Replit-specific development enhancements
- **esbuild**: Fast JavaScript bundler for production builds

## Deployment Strategy

### Development
- **Frontend**: Vite dev server with hot module replacement
- **Backend**: tsx for TypeScript execution with auto-restart
- **Database**: Drizzle Kit for schema management and migrations

### Production Build
- **Frontend**: Vite builds optimized static assets to `dist/public`
- **Backend**: esbuild bundles server code to `dist/index.js`
- **Serving**: Express serves both API routes and static frontend assets
- **Database**: Environment variable `DATABASE_URL` for connection configuration

### Key Build Commands
- `npm run dev`: Start development servers
- `npm run build`: Build both frontend and backend for production
- `npm run start`: Run production server
- `npm run db:push`: Apply database schema changes

The application follows a monorepo structure with shared TypeScript types between client and server, ensuring type safety across the full stack. The game mechanics are designed around hunger and thirst-based expedition systems with inventory management and crafting progression.
