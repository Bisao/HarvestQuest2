## Data Flow

1. **Client Initialization**: React app loads and queries player data
2. **Game State**: React Query manages server state caching and synchronization
3. **User Actions**: UI interactions trigger API calls through React Query mutations
4. **Server Processing**: Express routes handle business logic and database operations
5. **Database Updates**: Drizzle ORM executes type-safe database queries
6. **State Synchronization**: React Query automatically refetches related data after mutations
