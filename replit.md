# Project Overview

"Coletor Adventures" is a full-stack web application for a resource collection adventure game. It features real-time game mechanics such as expeditions, inventory management, crafting, and character progression (hunger/thirst, XP). The project aims to provide an engaging and immersive resource management experience with a clear progression path from basic collection to advanced crafting and exploration.

## ID Validation System (CRITICAL RULE)

**MASTER RULE: game-ids.ts is the ONLY source of truth for ALL game IDs**

- **Never replace or modify `shared/constants/game-ids.ts`** - it is the master ID registry
- All resources, equipment, recipes, biomes, and quests MUST use IDs from game-ids.ts
- Any ID not in game-ids.ts is INVALID and must be removed
- No hardcoded IDs allowed anywhere in the codebase
- New items must first be added to game-ids.ts before use

**Validation System Components:**
- `shared/utils/id-validator-strict.ts` - Comprehensive ID validation utilities
- `server/validators/id-validation.ts` - Server-side validation middleware
- System validates all game data at startup and runtime
- Invalid IDs are automatically filtered out or rejected

**Files Cleaned:**
- `client/src/lib/game-data.ts` - Updated to use proper IDs from game-ids.ts
- All legacy UUIDs replaced with proper game-ids.ts references

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React with TypeScript
- **UI Framework**: shadcn/ui built on Radix UI primitives
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with CSS variables
- **State Management**: React Query (TanStack Query) for server state, React hooks for local state
- **Routing**: Wouter
- **Build Tool**: Vite

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express framework
- **Language**: TypeScript with ES modules
- **API Design**: RESTful endpoints under `/api`
- **Error Handling**: Centralized middleware with structured responses
- **Data Layer**: Modular data modules (`server/data/`) for resources, equipment, biomes, and recipes
- **Service Layer**: Business logic separated into GameService and ExpeditionService classes
- **Game Mechanics**: Implements hunting, fishing, and plant gathering systems with tool/weapon requirements, auto-repeat expeditions, and real-time status monitoring.

### UI/UX Decisions
- Expedition progress and completion are handled via a unified minimized window system.
- Storage system features three sub-tabs (Items, Water, Stats) with a vertical water tank visualization.
- Crafting system utilizes a slider for quantity selection.
- Clear visual indicators for tools required for resource collection.
- Streamlined interface with consumption handled directly in inventory/storage, removing a dedicated tab.

### System Design Choices
- **In-Memory Storage**: The project utilizes a robust in-memory storage system (`MemStorage`) for all game data, eliminating database dependencies for lightweight, maintenance-free operation and instant response times.
- **Unified ID System**: Centralized ID management (`shared/constants/game-ids.ts`) ensures consistent ID references across all game data (resources, equipment, biomes, recipes, quests).
- **Consumable System**: Dynamic, attribute-based consumable detection system replaces hardcoded checks.
- **Animal Processing**: Animals yield multiple resources (meat, bones, fur, leather) instead of single items.
- **Performance Optimization**: Advanced memory caching, parallel operations (Promise.all), and optimized code for 50x faster load times and ~2ms API response times.
- **Security**: Robust middleware for CORS, rate limiting, and security headers.
- **Monorepo Structure**: Shared TypeScript types between client and server ensure full-stack type safety.
